[![grimoirelab-showcase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25265451/84442403-30dcce80-ac5b-11ea-9f5b-60266d875ebd.png "GrimoireLab | CHAOSS Bitergia Analytics")](https://chaoss.biterg.io/app/kibana#/dashboard/Overview)

GrimoireLab is a [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community) toolset for software development analytics. It includes a coordinated set of tools
to retrieve data from systems used to support software development (repositories), store it in databases,
enrich it by computing relevant metrics, and make it easy to run analytics and visualizations on it.

You can learn more about GrimoireLab in the [GrimoireLab tutorial](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/),
or visit the [GrimoireLab website](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab).

Metrics available in GrimoireLab are, in part, developed in the CHAOSS project. For more information regarding CHAOSS metrics, see the latest release at: https://chaoss.community/metrics/

# Getting started

To ease the newcomer experience we are providing a [default setup](default-grimoirelab-settings)
to analyze git activity for this repository. For this set up, there are several options to run GrimoireLab:

## Using `docker-compose`

Requirements:
* **Software**: [git](https://git-scm.com/), [docker client](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). An example of working configuration:
```console
root@test-68b8628f:~# git --version
git version 2.17.1
root@test-68b8628f:~# docker --version
Docker version 19.03.1, build 74b1e89
root@test-68b8628f:~# docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.22.0, build f46880fe
```
* **Hardware**: 2 CPU cores, 8GB memory RAM and [enough virtual memory for Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html) 

Steps:
1. Clone this project:
```console
git clone https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab
```
2. Go to `docker-compose` folder and run the following command:
```console
cd grimoirelab/docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

Your dashboard will be ready after a while at `http://localhost:9000`. The waiting time depends on the amount of data to fetch from a repo, for small repositories you can expect your data to be visible in the dashboard after 10-15 minutes.

More details or troubleshooting in the [docker-compose folder](./docker-compose/README.md).

## Using `docker run`

Requirements: 
* **Software**: [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [docker client](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). An example of working configuration:
```console
root@test-68b8628f:~# git --version
git version 2.17.1
root@test-68b8628f:~# docker --version
Docker version 19.03.1, build 74b1e89
```
* **Hardware**: 2 CPU cores, 8GB memory RAM and set
* ElasticSearch and Kibana up and running.
* SortingHat up and running

Steps:
1. Clone this project:
```console
git clone https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab
```
2. Go to the project folder and run the following command:
```console
cd grimoirelab
docker run --net=host \ 
    -v $(pwd)/default-grimoirelab-settings/projects.json:/home/grimoire/conf/projects.json \
    -v $(pwd)/default-grimoirelab-settings/setup-docker.cfg:/home/grimoire/conf/setup.cfg \
    -t grimoirelab/grimoirelab
```

Your dashboard will be ready after a while at `http://localhost:9000`. The waiting time depends on the amount of data to fetch from a repo, for small repositories you can expect your data to be visible in the dashboard after 10-15 minutes.

More details in the [docker folder](./docker/README.md).

# Breaking changes

## GrimoireLab `1.3.0`. SortingHat permission groups.

Starting from GrimoireLab 1.3.0, creating new users in SortingHat requires
assigning them to a permission group. By default, they will have read-only
permissions. Please refer to the following documentation for instructions
on how to update permissions: [assign users to permission groups](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat?tab=readme-ov-file#assign-users-to-permission-groups)

# GrimoireLab components

There are also some [components built by the GrimoreLab community](community_components.md),
which can be useful for you. Other related repositories are:
* [GrimoireLab Tutorial](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial)
* [GrimoireLab as a whole](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab) (this repository)

## Contents of this repository

This repository is for content relevant to GrimoireLab as a whole. For example:

* Issues for new features or bug reports that affect more than one GrimoireLab module. In this case, let's open an issue here, and when implementing the fix or the feature, let´s comment about the specific tickets in the specific modules that are used. For example, when supporting a new datasource, we will need patches (at least) in `Perceval`, `GrimoireELK` and panels. In this case, we would open a feature request (or the user story) for the whole case, an issue (and later a pull request) in `Perceval` for the data retriever, same for `GrimoireELK` for the enriching code, and same for `panels` for the Kibiter panels.

* Release notes for most GrimoireLab components (directory [releases](releases)).

* Docker container for showcasing GrimoireLab (directory [docker](docker)).
Includes a Dockerfile and configuration files for the GrimoireLab containers
that can be used to demo the technology, and can be the basis for real
deployments. See more information in the [docker README.md file](docker/README.md).

* If you feel more comfortable with `docker-compose`, the [docker-compose](docker-compose)
folder includes instructions and configuration files to deploy GrimoireLab using
`docker-compose` command.

* Source code of the GrimoireLab components is available in `src`. Each directory is a
Git submodule, so its contents will not be available after cloning the repository. To
fetch all the data, and get the latest version, you can run the following command:
```console
git submodule update --init --remote
```
